## Arrays

#### Static Array  
Lookup - O(1)
Append - O(1)
Insert - o(n)
Delete - O(n)

#### Dynamic Array  
Lookup - O(1)
Append - O(1)* : O(n) in case of reallocation of memory *(while other languages handles memory allocation by themselves, C has realloc() function)*
Insert - o(n)
Delete - O(n)

#### String Question
Convert string to array
C          : In C string is by itself stored as an array of characters. Hence its characters can be directly accessed by indexing.
C#, Java   : toCharArray()
Python     : list()
JavaScript : split()

#### Searching
Is array sorted?
  - If **Yes**, Binary Search : O(logN)
  - IF **No**
    - Will Sorting make solution efficient? 
      - If **Yes**, Sorting Algorithms
      - If **No**, Linear Search : O(n)
